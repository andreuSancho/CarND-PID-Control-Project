# PID Controller
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Introduction

To safely take control of the autonomous car steering wheel, the Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller is presented. This simple, yet effective algorithm computes proportional, integral, and derivative responses to compute the final steering wheel angle . The purpose of this project is to implement a PID controller in C++ and demonstrate its effectiveness in a simulator.

## Rubric points

In what follows the rubric points are discussed. Recall that we use the Cross-Track Error (CTE) as the measure of wellness. It computes the distance from the lane center.

### P, I, and D parts of the PID controller

**P, the proportional gain.** This coefficient causes the vehicle to steer proportional to the vehicle distance to the lane center (the aforesaid CTE). Therefore, the angles obtained can be very large and abrupt if CTE is high, and may the car oscillate wildly, turning from one side to another. Experimentally, low values (that is: less than 0.5) are preferred to avoid the sudden turns.

**D, the differential gain.** Differently from P, this coefficient is proportional to the rate of change of the CTE. This component balances (that is: decreases) the steering wheel angle if it is changing abruptly. Therefore, if P is set to high values, D helps by smoothing the behavior of the turns.

**I, the integral gain.** This coefficient sums the error term (that is: the CTE) over time. This way biases in steering wheel angle can be mitigated.

## Description of how the hyperparameters were chosen
Parameters were chosen experimentally by performing a grid search. First, the Kp was set to an initial 0.3 and Kd to 6 and the remaining parameter to zero. The car couldnâ€™t drive safely, so in the following iterations Kp was decreased by 0.01, while Kd was increased a unit. After a few iterations, the car could drive safely (albeit the oscillations). Next, the Ki parameter was set to 0.001 and later to 0.002. As similar results were reported, the hyperparameter search was stopped at this point.
The final values are the following:
- Kp = 0.22
- Ki = 0.002
- Kd = 14.0

It is important to highlight that the final steering angle is filtered in the following way: 
steer_value = -pid.TotalError() * 0.7 + angle * 0.3
where angle is the previous steering wheel angle in radians.

Also, a simple controller for the throttle is implemented in the following way:
throttle = (60.0 - speed) * 0.01
where 60.0 is the maximum speed that we want to achieve and 0.01 is a normalizing constant. Other speed maximums have been tested but this particular value makes the ride of the car safer.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
